%%%%%%%%% ABSTRACT
\begin{abstract}
%summarize the problem, main idea, and results;
The use of massive datasets like ImageNet and the revival of Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs) for learning deep features has significantly improved
the performance of object recognition. However, performance at scene
classification has not achieved the same level of success since there is still
semantic gap between the deep features and the high-level context.  In this
project we proposed a novel scene classification method which combines CNN and
Spatial Pyramid to generate high-level context-aware features for one-vs-all
linear SVMs. Our method achieves the state-of-the-art result: 68.04\% average
accuracy rate on MIT indoor67 dataset using only the deep features trained from
ImageNet.
